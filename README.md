## Synopsis

Simple utility for checking websites with time scheduling. An application that attempts to connect to a website or server every so many minutes or a given time and check if it is up. If it is down, it will notify you by email or by posting a notice on screen.

## Motivation

Developed by developers for developers mostly. Sometimes it can take a lot of efforts to support all sites and domains which you have to maintain. It can be a lot of accidents with them, as an example, it can be server/DNS/hosting errors, some problems with SSL, some issues after last upgrading and so on.
With this tool you can easily create some tasks with time scheduling. If the rules was not satisfied after last checking you will receive a notification to your email or some push notification with reason of an accident. So you will be able to start fixing this ASAP.
